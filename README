This is my repository for the code that I completed as part of the requirements of the Machine Learning Online Course by Stanford. The code here is my own work, when implementing the algorithms
and abides by the honour code of the class. It is here both for personal future reference and for anyone that would like to investigate the solutions. All exersises were marked 100%, hence the 
solutions are correct.
